# Numerical Methods for Kuramoto Delay Oscillators

The code to generate all plots in the manuscript 'Synchronization and resilience in the Kuramoto white matter network model with adaptive state-dependent delays'. All code is done in Python using the following libraries:

* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib

All scripts are done with Jupyter Notebook

# Libraries

Personal modules in the Libraries folder contains all relevant functions that provide the numerical methods. These are imported by the Jupyter Notebook scripts. The following is a quick guide describing what each module contains.

* comp_pack:
* fun_pack:
* num_pack:
* kura_pack:

# Figures

Each Jupyter Notebook file contains the exact script that was used to generate each plot in the manuscript. Cells in the scripts are able to generate and export the array files used, which are stored in the 'data' folder. Other cells in the scripts import and process the array files to plot the relevant graphs. We provide a quick guide in how to reproduce each figure:
